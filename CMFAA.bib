	abstract = {Growth of the single-fluid single-mode Rayleigh–Taylor instability ({RTI}) is revisited in 2D and 3D using fully compressible high-resolution simulations. We conduct a systematic analysis of the effects of perturbation Reynolds number (Rep) and Atwood number (A) on {RTI}’s late-time growth. Contrary to the common belief that single-mode {RTI} reaches a terminal bubble velocity, we show that the bubble re-accelerates when Rep is sufficiently large, consistent with Ramaparabhu et al. (2006) and Wei and Livescu (2012). However, unlike in Ramaparabhu et al. (2006), we find that for a sufficiently high Rep, the bubble’s late-time acceleration is persistent and does not vanish. Analysis of vorticity dynamics shows a clear correlation between vortices inside the bubble and re-acceleration. Due to symmetry around the bubble and spike (vertical) axes, the self-propagation velocity of vortices points in the vertical direction. If viscosity is sufficiently small, the vortices persist long enough to enter the bubble tip and accelerate the bubble (Wei and Livescu, 2012). A similar effect has also been observed in ablative {RTI} (Betti and Sanz, 2006). As the spike growth increases relative to that of the bubble at higher A, vorticity production shifts downward, away from the centerline and towards the spike tip. We modify the Betti–Sanz model for bubble velocity by introducing a vorticity efficiency factor η = 0.45 to accurately account for re-acceleration caused by vorticity in the bubble tip. It had been previously suggested that vorticity generation and the associated bubble re-acceleration are suppressed at high A. However, we present evidence that if the large Rep limit is taken first, bubble re-acceleration is still possible. Our results also show that re-acceleration is much easier to occur in 3D than 2D, requiring smaller Rep thresholds.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. {NumPy} is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Reaction–diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena. The most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.
Reaction–diffusion systems are naturally applied in chemistry. However, the system can also describe dynamical processes of non-chemical nature. Examples are found in biology, geology and physics (neutron diffusion theory) and ecology. Mathematically, reaction–diffusion systems take the form of semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations. They can be represented in the general form

  where q(x, t) represents the unknown vector function, D is a diagonal matrix of diffusion coefficients, and R accounts for all local reactions. The solutions of reaction–diffusion equations display a wide range of behaviours, including the formation of travelling waves and wave-like phenomena as well as other self-organized patterns like stripes, hexagons or more intricate structure like dissipative solitons. Such patterns have been dubbed "Turing patterns". Each function, for which a reaction diffusion differential equation holds, represents in fact a concentration variable.},
